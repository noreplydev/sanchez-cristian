# Hello 👋🏽, I'm Cristian Sánchez 

### Junior Android Developer &  learning IOS

My name is Cristian Sánchez, I currently live in Bilbao and study a medium degree in SMR at the San Luis center. Throughout my life I've had concerns, I have always been a very curious person. This curiosity has led me to disassemble a remote control car and turn it into a 360 ° camera, or work with Arduino boards, thus starting my first knowledge of programming when I was 11 years old. 

At the age of 13 I was able to buy my first desktop computer, this triggered me to sign up for a professional java training and to start using different programs. Two years later I finished my training and got a degree in java developer. Now, being 16 years old, I have already developed an android application, while I study I am working on other projects like:

- 📚 Studying [MSN](https://www.centrosanluis.com/estudios/microcomputer-systems-networks-programme "Microcomputer systems and networks")
- 🧑🏽‍💻 Coding for the new app: ██▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒  15%
- ⌨️ Learning Swift & Swift UI

## Knowledges

In programming I have knowledge in the following tools:

If I'm not really a frontend programmer, I'm really interested in user interface and user experience. That's why I've learned to use tools like after effects or illustrator.

## Lorpie

Lorpie is my first application, the idea of lorpie is not innovative by far, but it provides a simple and clean interface that makes it easy to use for people who are not tech interested.
