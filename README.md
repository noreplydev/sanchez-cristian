# Hello 👋🏽, I'm Cristian Sánchez 

### Junior Android Developer &  learning IOS

My name is Cristian Sánchez, I am 16 years old and 15 years ago I migrated from Venezuela to Spain. I currently live in Bilbao and study a medium degree in SMR at the San Luis center. Throughout my life I have had concerns, I have always been a very curious person. This curiosity has led me to disassemble a remote control car and turn it into a 360 ° camera, or work with Arduino boards, thus starting my first knowledge of programming when I was 11 years old. 

At the age of 13 I was able to buy my first desktop computer, this triggered me to sign up for a professional java training and to start using different programs. Two years later I finished my training and got a degree in java developer. Now, with 16 years old, I have already developed an android application and while I study I am working on other projects like:

- 📚 Studying [MSN](https://www.centrosanluis.com/estudios/microcomputer-systems-networks-programme "Microcomputer systems and networks")
- 🧑🏽‍💻 Coding for new secret app: ██▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒  15%
- ⌨️ Learning Swift & Swift UI

If I'm not really a frontend programmer, I'm really interested in user interface and user experience. That's why I've learned to use tools like after effects or illustrator.
