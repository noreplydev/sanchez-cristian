# Hello 👋🏽, I'm Cristian Sánchez 

### Frontend developer

My name is Cristian Sánchez, I currently live in Bilbao and study a medium degree in SMR at the San Luis center. Throughout my life I've had concerns, I have always been a very curious person. This curiosity has led me to disassemble a remote control car and turn it into a 360° camera, or work with Arduino boards, thus starting my first knowledge of programming when I was 11 years old. 

At the age of 13 I was able to buy my first desktop computer, this triggered me to sign up for a professional java training and to start using different programs. Two years later I finished my training and got a degree in java developer. Now, being 17 years old, I'm still learning frameworks as ReactJS and ExpressJS

## Lorpie

Lorpie is my first application. The idea of lorpie is not innovative by far, but it provides a simple and clean interface that makes it easy to use for people who are not tech interested.
